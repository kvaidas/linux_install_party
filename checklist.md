# Installation checklist
0. **Make sure you data is backed up**  
Check:
   - Desktop
   - Downloads
   - Data of any software you use

   Back your data to:
   - A different USB flash drive or USB hard drive
   - A cloud service like Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive or other
1. Make sure you know how to enter BIOS setup  
It's often by pressing F1, F2, F12, Delete or other keys while booting  
You might need to disable "Fast Startup". Here's how to do it: https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1045548/
1. Connect to the internet - use a cable or wifi as a last resort (this will be slow)
1. Download the ISO from one of these sources:
    - <local_url> (you can use <short_url>)
    - https://pub.linuxmint.io/stable/22.1/linuxmint-22.1-cinnamon-64bit.iso (might be slower, you can use the short url https://tinyurl.com/linuxip)  
If you can't download it for some reason (for example, slow wifi), ask someone to create the install media for you)
1. Download Balena Etcher from https://etcher.balena.io
1. Use Balena Etcher to write the ISO image to your USB flash drive
1. Set your computer to boot from your USB flash drive and boot it
1. Install
1. Check if you have all the required software
1. Play around with the software you're going to use and see if you find all the required functionality and that it works well
1. Run some tests (playing a youtube video tests a lot of things at once)
1. Install updates
1. Enjoy
